This is a brief approach of how I solve the problem.
1. first i open the words.txt, read it.
2. Then arrange the words in reverse order according to the length using sorted method.
3. appended the file into list 
4. to find the comprised word from the list i compared the words from descending ordered list to ascending ordered list
5. if the longest word is found the count increases 
6. the loop will execute untill it traverse all the words.
7. Why i use list data structure and not tree?
              I tried to execute the program using tree but it was very difficult and complex to create the tree and traverse all words from it vone by one, also we i could have used whoosh library to improve the time of execution but it will take a lost of storage from RAM or will lead to crash the system.
